                          <h3>LION</h3>
                          <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae; it is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, 
                              rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. The lion is sexually 
                              dimorphic; males are larger than females with a typical weight range of 150 to 250 kg (330 to 550 lb) for males 
                              and 120 to 182 kg (265 to 400 lb) for females. Male lions have a prominent mane, which is the most recognisable 
                              feature of the species. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Groups of female 
                              lions typically hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The species is an apex and keystone predator, 
                              although they scavenge when opportunities occur. Some lions have been known to hunt humans, although the 
                              species typically does not.</p>
